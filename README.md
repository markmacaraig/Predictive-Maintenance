Project Overview

This project allows prediction of machine or equipment failures based on a synthetic dataset. The models generated from this project allows for the implementation of a predictive maintenance program.

Installation and Setup:

Codes and Resources Used:

·      Editor: Jupyter Notebook
·      Python Version: 3.9.13

Python Packages Used:

·      Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
·      Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
·      Machine Learning: sklearn
 
Data:

Source Data:

·      AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset. (2020). UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5HS5C.

Results and Evaluation:

All three models used – logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors and random forest classifiers performed relatively well in predicting a machine/equipment failure based on the features selected for the models. The KNN and RFC models performed better than the logistic regression model, with the RFC model having the best overall performance.

Future work:

The next step is to be able to predict the cause of failure when the failure occurs. This prediction will be helpful along with what has been accomplished in this project for an overall predictive maintenance program.
